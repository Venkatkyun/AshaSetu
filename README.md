# AshaSetu 💠  
**Mobile-based EHR Companion for ASHA Workers in Low-Internet Areas**

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
**AshaSetu** is a lightweight, offline-first mobile solution designed to help **ASHA workers** and **Primary Health Center (PHC) staff** efficiently manage **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** in rural and low-connectivity regions of India.  

By enabling offline access, data synchronization, and simple user-friendly interfaces, AshaSetu empowers healthcare workers to continue their crucial tasks without being dependent on continuous internet access.
